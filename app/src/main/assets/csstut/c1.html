            <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
            <p>
                  CSS is used to define styles for  web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>
                  CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
            <p>
                  HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page.</p>
            <p>
                  HTML was created to <strong>describe the content</strong> of a web page, like:</p>
            <p>
                  &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
            <p>
                  &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p>
                  When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
            <p>
                  To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
            <p>
                  CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
            <hr />
            <h2>
                  CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
            <p>
                  The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
            <p>
                  With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
